# 16/27-notes

This project is all about building a note-taking web application. (It'll have
limited features, due to time constraints)

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and
for state management [jotai](https://jotai.org) also use
[auto-animate by formkit](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) for nicer animation
(although some time it seems broken).

If you are interested, checkout
